/**
 * HijelHID_BLEKeyboard.h
 *
 * BLE HID keyboard library for ESP32, built on NimBLE-Arduino 2.3.8+
 *
 * Supports all keys on a standard 104/105-key keyboard with numpad,
 * consumer/media keys, international and language keys.
 *
 * Both keyboard keys (KEY_*) and consumer/media keys (MEDIA_*) are sent
 * through the same press() / release() / releaseAll() / tap() API.
 * The correct HID report is selected automatically based on the value passed:
 *   - KEY_*   values are uint8_t  — sent via the keyboard report (Report ID 1)
 *   - MEDIA_* values are uint16_t — sent via the consumer report (Report ID 2)
 *
 * Dependencies:
 *   - NimBLE-Arduino >= 2.3.8  (install via Arduino Library Manager)
 *   - ESP32 Arduino Core >= 3.3.7

// TAP_DELAY_MS: how long a key is held down before release (milliseconds).
// KEY_GAP_MS:   gap between the release of one tap and the next press (ms).
//
// Both values default to 25ms. iOS/iPadOS require at least ~15ms for each
// to reliably register every keypress, including repeated identical keys.
// Adjust globally with setTapDelay() / setKeyGap(), or override per-call
// using the delayMs and keyGap parameters on tap().

// ─── Peripheral Latency / Idle Power Saving ────────────────────────────────
// When no key has been pressed for HID_IDLE_THRESHOLD_MS milliseconds, the
// library requests a connection parameter update with slave latency applied.
// This allows the BLE radio to skip up to HID_IDLE_LATENCY consecutive
// connection events, reducing the effective radio duty cycle from ~133/sec
// to ~1.6/sec during idle — a significant power saving with no impact on
// typing responsiveness (the first keypress immediately restores full rate).
//
// The host is not required to accept connection parameter update requests.
// iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux will generally honour them, but the timing
// and acceptance are host-controlled. Power saving is best-effort.
//
// On single-core ESP32 variants (C3, C6, C2, H2), the NimBLE host task and
// the Arduino loop task share one CPU. The param update is posted to the
// NimBLE task queue from the Arduino loop task — it takes effect once the
// NimBLE task gets CPU time, which happens naturally at the next delay()
// call inside tap(). This means the transition has slightly more latency on
// single-core boards than on dual-core (ESP32, S3), but is functionally correct.
#define HID_IDLE_THRESHOLD_MS   5000   // inactivity before requesting idle params
#define HID_IDLE_LATENCY          80   // slave latency events to skip when idle
#define HID_CONN_INTERVAL          6   // shared connection interval: 6 × 1.25ms = 7.5ms (Active and Idle states both use this interval; slave latency is what differs)
#define HID_CONN_TIMEOUT         300   // supervision timeout: 300 × 10ms = 3000ms

// ─── String Length Limits ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Device name: BLE scan response packet is 31 bytes; 2 bytes are consumed by
//   AD type+length overhead, leaving 29 bytes for the name string.
//   Names longer than 29 chars are truncated; a warning prints in begin().
//
// Manufacturer: stored in the GATT Device Information Service characteristic
//   (UUID 0x2A29), read only after connection — not in the advertising packet.
//   The Bluetooth Core Spec defines 512 bytes as the maximum GATT attribute
//   length. Strings longer than 512 chars are truncated; a warning prints in begin().
